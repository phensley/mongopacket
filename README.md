# mongopacket

This is a quick hack to parse MongoDB wire messages out of packet captures, attempting to resynchronize streams to tolerate some packet loss. It was built in support of an effort to diagnose issues with MongoDB, so has only been tested against a few packet captures for my environment.

It corrects an issue where requestID and responseTo values generated by the database are full uint32, not int32 as MongoDB's wire protocol documentation states.
